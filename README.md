# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application saw the value in testing, included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/), and started writing the first test suite. However, they left an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## What will I learn?

You will learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## How will this help my career?

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.


# How will I continue this project?

Review the Feed Reader Testing [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/3442558598/rubric)

1. Take the JavaScript Testing [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud549)
2. Download the required project assets: [here (original)](http://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader) or [here (Amy's fork)](https://github.com/amyFEND/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).
    - Clone repository to download all required files
    - Open index.html file within your browser to see the web page and Jasmine testing results will show at bottom of loaded page
3. Review the functionality of the application within your browser.
4. Callbacks should be used to ensure that feeds are loaded before they are tested.
5. Implement error handling for undefined variables and out-of-bound array access.
6. When complete - all of your tests should pass.
7. Update README file detailing all steps required to successfully run the application. If you have added additional tests (for Udacious Test Coverage),  provide documentation for what these future features are and what the tests are checking for.
